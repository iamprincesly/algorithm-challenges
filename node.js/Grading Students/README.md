# Grading Students Algorithm
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any  less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

If the difference between the  and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round  up to the next multiple of 5.

If the value of 38 is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
